# Danish-Fahim
I'm a Junior level programmer who has been programming since 2016, or 2015 if you count turing. I know how to use Turing, Java, a little bit of C++, html, and Lua. I'm created many programs, the ones I have uploaded to this site are an email server, a video game which I am currently developing, and a game which I created back in grade 9.
