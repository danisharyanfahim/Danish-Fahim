# 2025 Update
These are the first projects I started my programming journey back in 2014. It's been over 10 years since then, and I have learned a variety of languages.  The first language I learned was Turing. The first project I made was a plane game in Turing, which was my final-year project for my grade 9 CS class. Afterwards, the language I mainly used was Java, and I have been using it for almost 10 years now. This is what you will find in this folder:
-My First Project (2015)
-Java Programs and Tutorials I wrote for my CS classes between 2016 to 2018, including an email server (Grade 12, final year project)

I'm a Junior level programmer who has been programming since 2015. I know how to use Turing, Java, a little bit of C++, html, and Lua. I have created many programs; the ones I have uploaded to this site are an email server, a video game which I am currently developing, and another completed game which I created back in grade 9.
